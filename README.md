# Frontend: Resume Visualizer

This is an implementation of the Frontend challenge.

Users can enter text and click "Aanlyze Resume" to analyze the results, which includes a printing out of the resume as well as the top 10 most frequent words that appeared in the result presented in a bar chart.

Users can also upload a PDF of their resume, however currently the only feature supported for this is displaying the name and file size of the PDF (the PDF itself is not printed out or analyzed).

## To Run

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Then go to
### `http://localhost:3000/`
